# Simulation (rough notes)

## Things to consider

* Simplest environment - by using `.qmd`, I am then requiring `ipykernel` which has lots of dependencies

## Random sampling

```{python}
import numpy as np

# This is essentially our "starter seed"
entropy = 12345

# Generate 10 seeds which will create independent streams
ss = np.random.SeedSequence(entropy)
seeds = ss.spawn(10)

# Initialise RNGs with independent seeds
rng = np.random.default_rng(seeds[0])
rng1 = np.random.default_rng(seeds[1])

# Generate random numbers
print(rng.random(), rng1.random())
```
